This lab has been created from the R markdown file for Chapter 6 of the textbook "An introduction to statistical learning", available [here](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-second-edition)

Here we apply the best subset selection approach to the `Hitters` data.
We wish to predict a baseball player's `Salary` on the basis of various statistics associated with performance in the previous year.

First of all, we note that the `Salary` variable is missing for some of the players.  The `is.na()` function can be used to identify the missing observations. It returns a vector of the same length as the input vector, with a `TRUE` for any elements that are missing, and a `FALSE` for non-missing elements.
 The `sum()` function can then be used to count all of the missing elements.

```{r chunk1}
library(ISLR2)
names(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
sum(is.na(Hitters$Salary))
```

Hence we see that `Salary` is missing for $59$ players. The `na.omit()` function removes all of the rows that have missing values in any variable.

```{r chunk2}
Hitters <- na.omit(Hitters)
```


## Ridge Regression and the Lasso

We will use the `glmnet` package in order to perform ridge regression and the lasso.
The main function in this package is `glmnet()`, which can be used to fit ridge regression models, lasso models, and more.
This function has slightly different syntax from other model-fitting functions that we have encountered thus far in this book. In particular, we must pass in an `x` matrix as well as a `y` vector, and we do not use the `y ~ x` syntax. We will now perform ridge regression and the lasso in order to predict `Salary` on the `Hitters` data. Before proceeding ensure that the missing values have been removed from the data, as described in Section 6.5.1.


```{r chunk25}
x <- model.matrix(Salary ~ ., Hitters)[, -1]
y <- Hitters$Salary
```

The `model.matrix()` function is particularly useful for creating `x`; not only does it produce a matrix corresponding to the $19$ predictors but it also automatically transforms any qualitative variables into dummy variables. The latter property is important because `glmnet()` can only take numerical, quantitative inputs.

### Ridge Regression

The `glmnet()` function has an `alpha` argument that determines what type of model is fit. If `alpha=0` then a ridge regression model is fit, and if `alpha=1`
then a lasso model is fit. We first fit a ridge regression model.

```{r chunk26}
library(glmnet)
grid <- 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100)
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0, lambda = grid)
```

By default the `glmnet()` function performs ridge regression for an automatically selected range of $\lambda$ values. However, here we have chosen to implement the function over a grid of values ranging from $\lambda=10^{10}$ to $\lambda=10^{-2}$, essentially covering the full range of scenarios from the null model containing only the intercept, to the least squares fit. As we will see, we can also compute model fits for a particular value of $\lambda$ that is not one of the original `grid` values. Note that by default, the `glmnet()` function standardizes the variables so that they are on the same scale. To turn off this default setting, use the argument `standardize = FALSE`.

Associated with each value of $\lambda$ is a vector of ridge regression coefficients, stored in a matrix that can be accessed by `coef()`. In this case, it is a $20 \times 100$
matrix, with $20$ rows (one for each predictor, plus an intercept) and $100$ columns (one for each value of $\lambda$).

```{r chunk27}
dim(coef(ridge.mod))
```

We expect the coefficient estimates to be much smaller, in terms of $\ell_2$ norm, when a large value of $\lambda$ is used, as compared to when a small value of
$\lambda$ is used. These are the coefficients when $\lambda=11{,}498$, along with their $\ell_2$ norm:

```{r chunk28}
ridge.mod$lambda[50]
coef(ridge.mod)[, 50]
sqrt(sum(coef(ridge.mod)[-1, 50]^2))
```

In contrast, here are the coefficients when $\lambda=705$, along with their $\ell_2$ norm. Note the much larger $\ell_2$ norm of the coefficients associated with this smaller value of $\lambda$.

```{r chunk29}
ridge.mod$lambda[60]
coef(ridge.mod)[, 60]
sqrt(sum(coef(ridge.mod)[-1, 60]^2))
```

We can use the `predict()` function for a number of purposes. For instance, we can obtain the ridge regression coefficients for a new value of $\lambda$, say $50$:

```{r chunk30}
predict(ridge.mod, s = 50, type = "coefficients")[1:20, ]
```


We  now split the samples into a training set and a test set in order to estimate the test error of ridge regression and the lasso. There are two common ways to randomly split a data set. The first is to produce a random vector of `TRUE`, `FALSE` elements and select the observations corresponding to `TRUE` for the training data. The second is to randomly choose a subset of numbers between $1$ and $n$; these can then be used as the indices for the training observations. The two approaches work equally well. We used the former method in Section 6.5.1. Here we demonstrate the latter approach.

We first set a random seed so that the results obtained will be reproducible.

```{r chunk31}
set.seed(1)
train <- sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x) / 2)
test <- (-train)
y.test <- y[test]
```

Next we fit a ridge regression model on the training set, and evaluate its MSE on the test set, using $\lambda=4$.  Note the use of the `predict()` function again. This time we get predictions for a test set, by replacing `type="coefficients"` with the `newx` argument.

```{r chunk32}
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0,
    lambda = grid, thresh = 1e-12)
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = 4, newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)
```

The test MSE is $142{,}199$.
Note that if we had instead simply fit a model with just an intercept, we would have predicted each test observation using the mean of the training observations. In that case, we could compute the test set MSE like this:

```{r chunk33}
mean((mean(y[train]) - y.test)^2)
```

We could also get the same result by fitting a ridge regression model with a *very* large value of $\lambda$. Note that `1e10` means $10^{10}$.

```{r chunk34}
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = 1e10, newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)
```

So fitting a ridge regression model with $\lambda=4$ leads to a much lower test MSE than fitting a model with just an intercept.
We now check whether there is any benefit to performing ridge regression with $\lambda=4$ instead of just performing least squares regression. 
Recall that least squares is simply ridge regression with $\lambda=0$. (In order for `glmnet()` to yield the exact least squares coefficients when $\lambda=0$, we use the argument `exact = T` when calling the `predict()` function. Otherwise, the `predict()` function will interpolate over the grid of $\lambda$ values used in fitting the `glmnet()` model, yielding approximate results. When we use `exact = T`, there remains a slight discrepancy in the third decimal place between the output of `glmnet()` when $\lambda = 0$ and the output of `lm()`; this  is due to numerical approximation on the part of `glmnet()`.)


```{r chunk35}
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = 0, newx = x[test, ],
    exact = T, x = x[train, ], y = y[train])
mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)
lm(y ~ x, subset = train)
predict(ridge.mod, s = 0, exact = T, type = "coefficients",
    x = x[train, ], y = y[train])[1:20, ]
```

In general,  if we want to fit a (unpenalized) least squares model, then we should use the `lm()` function, since that function provides more useful outputs, such as standard errors and p-values for the coefficients.

In general, instead of arbitrarily choosing $\lambda=4$, it would be better to use cross-validation to choose the tuning parameter $\lambda$.
We can do this using the built-in cross-validation function, `cv.glmnet()`.  By default, the function performs ten-fold cross-validation, though this can be changed using the argument `nfolds`. Note that we set a random seed first so our results will be reproducible, since the choice of the cross-validation folds is random.

```{r chunk36}
set.seed(1)
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0)
plot(cv.out)
bestlam <- cv.out$lambda.min
bestlam
```

Therefore, we see that the value of $\lambda$ that results in the smallest cross-validation error is $326$. What is the test MSE associated with this value of $\lambda$?

```{r chunk37}
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = bestlam,
    newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)
```

This represents a further improvement over the test MSE that we got using $\lambda=4$.
Finally, we refit our ridge regression model on the full data set, using the value of $\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation, and examine the coefficient estimates.

```{r chunk38}
out <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
predict(out, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam)[1:20, ]
```

As expected, none of the coefficients are zero---ridge regression does not perform variable selection!

### The Lasso

We saw that ridge regression with a wise choice of $\lambda$ can outperform least squares as well as the null model on the `Hitters` data set. We now ask whether the lasso can yield either
a more accurate or a more interpretable model than ridge regression. In order to fit a lasso model, we once again use the `glmnet()` function; however, this time we
use the argument
`alpha=1`. Other than that change, we proceed just as we did in fitting a ridge model.

```{r chunk39}
lasso.mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1,
    lambda = grid)
plot(lasso.mod)
```

We can see from the coefficient plot that depending on the choice of tuning parameter, some of the coefficients will be exactly equal to zero.
We now perform cross-validation and compute the associated test error.

```{r chunk40}
set.seed(1)
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1)
plot(cv.out)
bestlam <- cv.out$lambda.min
lasso.pred <- predict(lasso.mod, s = bestlam,
    newx = x[test, ])
mean((lasso.pred - y.test)^2)
```

This is substantially lower than the test set MSE of the null model and of least squares, and very similar to the test MSE of ridge regression with $\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation.

However, the lasso has a substantial advantage over ridge regression in that the resulting coefficient estimates are sparse. Here we see that 8 of the 19 coefficient estimates are exactly
zero. So the lasso model with $\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation contains only eleven variables.

```{r chunk41}
out <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = grid)
lasso.coef <- predict(out, type = "coefficients",
    s = bestlam)[1:20, ]
lasso.coef
lasso.coef[lasso.coef != 0]
```



## PCR and PLS Regression

### Principal Components Regression


Principal components regression (PCR) can be performed using the `pcr()` function, which is part of the `pls` library. We now apply PCR to the `Hitters` data, in order to predict `Salary`. Again,
 we ensure that the missing values have been removed from the data, as described in Section 6.5.1.

```{r chunk42}
library(pls)
set.seed(2)
pcr.fit <- pcr(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters, scale = TRUE,
    validation = "CV")
```

The syntax for the `pcr()` function is similar to that for `lm()`, with a few additional
options. Setting `scale = TRUE` has the effect of *standardizing* each
predictor, using (6.6), prior to generating the principal
components, so that the scale on which each variable is measured will not have an effect.
 Setting `validation = "CV"` causes
`pcr()` to compute the ten-fold cross-validation error for each possible
value of $M$, the number of principal components used. The resulting fit can be examined using `summary()`.

```{r chunk43}
summary(pcr.fit)
```

The CV score is provided for each possible number of components, ranging
from $M=0$ onwards. (We have printed the CV output only up to $M=4$.)
Note that  `pcr()` reports the *root mean squared error*; in order to obtain the usual MSE, we must square this quantity. For instance, a root mean squared error of $352.8$ corresponds to an MSE of
$352.8^2=124{,}468$.

One can also plot the cross-validation scores using the
`validationplot()` function. Using `val.type = "MSEP"`
will cause the cross-validation MSE to be plotted.

```{r chunk44}
validationplot(pcr.fit, val.type = "MSEP")
```

We see that the smallest cross-validation error occurs when $M=18$ components are used. This is barely fewer than $M=19$, which amounts to simply performing least squares, because when all of the components are used in PCR no dimension reduction occurs. However, from the plot we also see that the cross-validation error is roughly the same when only one component is included in the model. This suggests that a model that uses just a small number of components might suffice.

 The
`summary()` function also provides the *percentage of variance explained* in the predictors and in the response using different numbers of components. This concept is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12.
   Briefly, we can think of this as
the amount of information about the predictors or the
response that is captured using $M$ principal components. For example,
setting $M=1$ only captures $38.31 \%$ of all the variance, or information,
in the predictors. In contrast, using $M=5$ increases the value to $84.29 \%$. If we
were to use all $M=p=19$ components, this would increase to $100 \%$.


We now
perform PCR on the training data and evaluate its test set performance.

```{r chunk45}
set.seed(1)
pcr.fit <- pcr(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters, subset = train,
    scale = TRUE, validation = "CV")
validationplot(pcr.fit, val.type = "MSEP")
```

Now we find that the lowest cross-validation error occurs when $M=5$ components are used.
We compute the test MSE as follows.

```{r chunk46}
pcr.pred <- predict(pcr.fit, x[test, ], ncomp = 5)
mean((pcr.pred - y.test)^2)
```

This test set MSE is competitive with the results obtained using ridge regression and the lasso. However, as a result of the way PCR is implemented, the final model is more difficult to interpret because it does not perform any kind of variable selection or even directly produce coefficient estimates.

Finally, we fit PCR on the full data set, using $M=5$, the number of components identified by cross-validation.

```{r chunk47}
pcr.fit <- pcr(y ~ x, scale = TRUE, ncomp = 5)
summary(pcr.fit)
```





### Partial Least Squares


We implement partial least squares (PLS) using the `plsr()` function, also in the `pls` library. The syntax is just like that of the `pcr()` function.

```{r chunk48}
set.seed(1)
pls.fit <- plsr(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters, subset = train, scale = TRUE, validation = "CV")
summary(pls.fit)
validationplot(pls.fit, val.type = "MSEP")
```

The lowest cross-validation error occurs when only $M=1$ partial least squares directions are used. We now evaluate the corresponding test set MSE.

```{r chunk49}
pls.pred <- predict(pls.fit, x[test, ], ncomp = 1)
mean((pls.pred - y.test)^2)
```

The test MSE is comparable to, but slightly higher than, the test MSE obtained using ridge regression, the lasso, and PCR.

Finally, we perform PLS using the full data set, using $M=1$, the number of components identified by cross-validation.

```{r chunk50}
pls.fit <- plsr(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters, scale = TRUE,
    ncomp = 1)
summary(pls.fit)
```

Notice that the percentage of variance in `Salary` that the one-component PLS fit explains, $43.05 \%$, is almost as much as that explained using the final five-component model PCR fit, $44.90 \%$. This is because PCR only attempts to maximize the amount of variance explained in the predictors, while PLS searches for directions that explain variance in both the predictors and the response.
