\section{Rice Varieties}

\subsection{Dataset}

All following considerations are made using the datasets provided on the challenge page (\textit{rice_test.csv} and \texitit{rice_train.csv}), but it is worth noting that a more complete version of them can be found at the [datasets source page](https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/). I used it to compute an alternative version of the *test* dataset that contains the true attribute for *Class*.
